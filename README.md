## Scripts
List of scripts which are needed every working day.

### How to use
- make a submodule of this repository inside your project at `./scripts/` as example.
- the best way is to use autocompletion `tab` key on every file path.

** when you will enter the text `sh sc` just tap `tab` key to complete the command to `sh scripts/` or type `tab` twice to show variants.

### Structure

- `folder name` as a group of commands like `bundle` for the bundler or `pod` for the cocoapods etc.

- [behavior scripts for xcode](./behavior/README.md)
